# Alexandria
The Alexandria Project is a e-Library where you may share your knowledge through books, podcasts and docs. #KnowledgeForEveryone

## The Philosophy
"Knowledge is power"

We believe in a world where knowledge is reachable for everyone. No restrictions.
If you learn something, you might share it to grow all together and accomplish even greater things.
We encourage you to start sharing your knowledge with someone else, maybe you could need his/her help in a near future, who knows.

## Objective
Nowadays, internet is so big that we are now flooded with tons of information, some of it useful but sometimes it's just outdated or wrong.

We give people the possibility to upload their useful resources everytime they want into the Alexandria's network, so they may get feedback and keep improving. All of this along with the benefit of consuming other's resources whenever they want.

## How?
We make use of the latest technology trends to become a highly-trusted network.
Using a microservice-oriented architecture at the infrastructure layer ensures the project's capability of maintenance.
Besides of using a modern architecture at the infrastructure layer, we make use of powerful languages such as Go & Python for our microservices creation along with a RDBMS such as PostgreSQL and a in-memory database such as Redis for our main persistence layer.
Everything gets coupled using an Event Bus like NATS, AWS SQS-SNS or RabbitMQ.
