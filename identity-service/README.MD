# Identity Service API
The Identity service API handles all the user's domain operations.

It contains multi-layered APIs such as Public, Private and Admin API. 

It uses gRPC and HTTP communication protocols to expose its APIs.

The Identity API v1 is using Amazon Web Service's Cognito as user pool and identity federation manager.
